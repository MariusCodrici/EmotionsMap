# EmotionsMap
The application allows the manual introduction of one of the five basic emotions felt (after Paul Ekman) for a period of time and their graphical representation. The main advantage of the application is to raise awareness of your emotions.

The application is securely written in Javascript (openUI5\sapUI5)  and does not export data to any external system. It can be sent by email or saved in the cloud space of the phone and opened from there.
